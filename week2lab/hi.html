					Hello, my name is Muhammad Arfan Muhaimin bin Mohamed Shamsudin and my nickname is Arfan. This is my page for the week 2 laboratory assignment of TP2543 Web Programming Course which is where I'll describe a short introduction of myself like my favourite places, my computing skill, and favourite pictures. I am currently pursuing my bachelor degree in Software Engineering (Information System) at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.<br /><br />
					A little information about me is that I love and enjoy solving problems. I have always been driven by my curisioty in finding answers to the most interesting problems . Also, I likely to programming, developing and do research about the future technology that can bring benefit to the world. Other than that, I would claim myself as an epistemophile person as I always search for an opportunity to learn something new (although I'm an introvert).
